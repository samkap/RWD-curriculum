# RWD Checklist

## Setting Up HTML

* First line in your HTML files should be the HTML5 version of Doctype
<!DOCTYPE html>

* Link HTML pages to CSS stylesheets. This goes in the head of the document.
<link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">

* Meta tags for description, UTF-8, and viewport. Read this post about viewport codes.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

## CSS checklist

* Using a Reset.css or Normalize.css

* List two or more fall-back typefaces.
font-face: "Adobe Caslon Pro", Georgia, serif;
* All typography is in ems.

* All width is in percentages, except max-widths.

* All media queries have a closing } that doesn't belong to another element.

* Make all images resize.
img {max-width:100&}

* Put a max-width on your containing or wrapper div
